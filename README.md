# CLI Pomodoro Timer(WIP)

This is project is a simple CLI Pomodoro Timer built using Golang. I have always wanted to build a Pomodoro Timer and I thought it would be a good idea to build one using Golang.

## Features

- View the time left for the current timer
- Automatically play music to help users focus
- Turns on DND mode to help users focus.
